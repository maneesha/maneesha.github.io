This is adapted from a Cooks Illustrated recipe for Quick Stovetop Roast Chicken (November/December 2008), to be not so quick -- because long and slow roasted chicken is way better. Active cooking time remains the same but total cooking time goes up by about an hour.

### Chicken
* 6 bone in, skin on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and skin
* Salt and Pepper
* 1 tsp vegetable oil
* 1 cup chicken broth

### Pan Sauce

* 1-2 shallots, chopped fine (about 3-4 tablespoons)
* 2 tsp all purpose flour
* zest of 1 lemon
* juice of 1 lemon
* 2 tb chopped parsley
* 2 tb drained capers

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.  Heat 1 tsp in large cast iron or carbon steel pan.  Add chicken thighs skin side down and cook without moving them until skin is golden brown, about 5-8 minutes.

Flip chicken skin side up.  Add chicken broth and bring to simmer. Cover pan and put in oven for one hour.

Remove pan from oven, and move chicken to  plate, keeping it skin side up.  

Pour off liquid from pan into fat separator and allow to settle for 10 minutes.  While this sits, return chicken pieces to pan, skin side down, and cook without moving them until skin is deep golden brown, about 5-8 minutes. Put back on plate and tent loosely with foil.

Pour liquid from fat separator into measuring cup and add water or broth to total 1 cup.  Add 1 tsp of chicken fat to pan. Add in shallots and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds.  Add in reserved chicken cooking liquid and bring to a simmer, scraping up the brown bits.  Off heat, add in lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley, and capers. 

Serve chicken with sauce on side. Do not pour over chicken - this will ruin the crispy skin.
